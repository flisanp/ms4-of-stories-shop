### User Stories  
![user stories](static/README/user_stories/user-stories-MS4.png)

### Design   
I wanted the site to be easy navigated with a clean and minimalistic design. The focus should be on the images of the products.

 #### Colors  
Beyond white for the navbar and footer and a darker grey #555 for the body text I wanted to have a main color that was calming for the eye and that was representing nature and sustainability. I choose two different shades of green that I thought fit this purpose perfectly, #637867 & #939891. #F2F1EF was picked from the hero image on the index page and used as an  background overlay to tie the pages together.
