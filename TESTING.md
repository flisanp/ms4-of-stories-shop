# Testing  

## Validator Testing  


### HTML Testing
[W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate HTML.  
No errors were found  

### CSS Testing 

[W3C CSS Markup Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) was used to validate CSS.  
No errors were found  

### Python
[PEP8 online](http://pep8online.com/) was used to validate Python.  
No errors were found


### JS Testing  
[JShint](https://jshint.com/) was used to validate JavaScript.  
When running the js files through JShint the linter throws a warning regarding an undefined variable. This is because the $ sign is jQuery syntax and the linter is checking for ES6 syntax which jQuery operators aren't a part of.

## During Development I Fixed The Following Bugs

 - When I clicked on the checkout button I got an error saying "local variable 'order_form' referenced before assignment" and it said the issue was in checkout views. 

<br>
<img src="static/README/bugs/local_variable_bug.png" width="auto" height="300"/>
<br>

When I googled the issue it says that this occurs when some variable is referenced before assignment within a functionâ€™s body. It turned out it was a small indentation error. The form was nested in the GET block: when a POST request is made to the view it cannot find the form as value is only assigned upon a GET request. I had the else block that rendered the form within the block of code that run only on GET requests, 
and with the indentation error order_form had no value on POST

<br>
<img src="static/README/bugs/order_form.png" width="auto" height="300"/>
<br>

- I've got a Page not found , 404 error on the add_blog page 

<br>
<img src="static/README/bugs/page_not_found.png" width="auto" height="300"/>
<br>

I moved the url above the other ones and then it worked perfecly. It was most likely that Django tried the patterns in order and found a "match" before the intended.

---

- I've got a 500 error on two of my pages, the blog and the shop in my deployed heroku app. 

<br>
<img src="static/README/bugs/blog_error.png" width="auto" height="300"/>
<br>
 
I put a DEVELOPMENT variable in my Heroku config vars to get a better idea of what's going on. The error showing was:

<br>
<img src="static/README/bugs/programming_error.png" width="auto" height="300"/>
<br>

To fix this problem I needed to run migrations on the postgres database:

1. logged in to the heroku cli in my workspace terminal: heroku login -i
2. then, I migrate with: heroku run python3 manage.py migrate

---

- The footer didn't stick to the bottom of the page if there wasn't enough content

<br>
<img src="static/README/bugs/footer-bug.png" width="auto" height="300"/>
<br>

This issue was solved by adding 
`<div class=content> </div>`
around the block content in base.html and adding this styling to css:

`html, body {
  height: 100%;
}`

`body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}`

`.content {
  flex: 1 0 auto;
}`

`.footer {
  flex-shrink: 0;
}`

Now everything was working except on the index page where the footer now was in the middle of the page below the hero image. 

<br>
<img src="static/README/bugs/footer-bug-mid-page.png" width="auto" height="100"/>
<br>

It turned out I had added h-100 to my index-hero container class and it was setting the element to be 100% of device height and not allowing the div to stretch for full content. I already had the height set to 100vh in base.css on index-hero so it was extra anyway. When I removed this everything worked.


### Responsiveness issues  

- When I test the responsiveness on Nest Hub and Ipad Mini in landscape mode I get issues with the search bar. The button appears underneath the input field instead of next to it. When I remove flex-flow: row wrap; in DevTools they're aligned but since this only appears on screensizes between 992px - 1120px and deadline is coming up I've decided to keep it like that for the time beeing and fix it in the future.
