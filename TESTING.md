## During Development I Fixed The Following Bugs

 - When I clicked on the checkout button I got an error saying "local variable 'order_form' referenced before assignment" and it said the issue was in checkout views. 

<br>
<img src="static/README/bugs/local_variable_bug.png" width="500" height="300"/>
<br>

When I googled the issue it says that this occurs when some variable is referenced before assignment within a functionâ€™s body. It turned out it was a small indentation error. The form was nested in the GET block: when a POST request is made to the view it cannot find the form as value is only assigned upon a GET request. I had the else block that rendered the form within the block of code that run only on GET requests, 
and with the indentation error order_form had no value on POST

- When I wanted to reach the add_blog page I got: Page not found , 404 error. 

<br>
<img src="static/README/bugs/page_not_found.png" width="500" height="300"/>
<br>

I moved the url above the other ones and it worked perfecly. It was most likely that Django tried the patterns in order and found a "match" before the intended.

- I get a 500 error when I click on the blog page in my deployed heroku app
